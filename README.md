# JavaScript Project: iiBi

## Overview

iiBi is a simple visualization of stock growth. iiBi allows the user to select from a series of stocks to display
the respective stock's performance.

The user will be able to smoothly transition between stocks to display and the user will be able to follow along the path
of the data. The data will display the appropriate data relative to the position of the cursor over the graph.
